# Infinite_Scroll
Loading a csv file data on to html table using Ajax and jQuery and displaying with Infinite Scroll(Unpagination)


UI technologies:
HTML5
jQuery
Ajax
Bootstrap
CSS

Prerequisites:
Mozilla Firefox
(or)
.net framework to launch the html file.
(we have to use IDE-Apache server or .net framework-IIS beacuse when Project is to be loaded , browser will render HTML and run Javascript, jQuery, angularJs in your browser without needing a server set up. But many web browsers are programed to watch for cross site attacks, and will block requests Error:XMLHttpRequest cannot load file. Cross origin requests are only supported for HTTP)

Getting Started:
Launch infiniteScroll.html in Mozilla Firefox  and then by clicking on "Load Data" button, the data from the employee.csv file is displayed on to html table by ajax calls and by using jquery infinite scroll can be achieved.
